For companies, the possibility of surviving is parallel with the accuracy of these predictions in increasing competition environment. According to this idea, demand forecast has vital importance for all companies. The purpose of the forecast is to predict situations companies may face in the future, using different data and techniques and take action in advance. Demand forecasting is to determine the demand level of a product or some products of a company for a specific time in the future. There are many methods used to forecast demand which are critical for companies. In this study, explained demand forecasting methods and made literature survey.},

  abstract = {Forecasting time series data is an important subject in economics, business, and finance. Traditionally, there are several techniques to effectively forecast the next lag of time series data such as univariate Autoregressive (AR), univariate Moving Average (MA), Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), and more notably Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with its many variations. In particular, ARIMA model has demonstrated its outperformance in precision and accuracy of predicting the next lags of time series. With the recent advancement in computational power of computers and more importantly developing more advanced machine learning algorithms and approaches such as deep learning, new algorithms are developed to forecast time series data. The research question investigated in this article is that whether and how the newly developed deep learning-based algorithms for forecasting time series data, such as "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)", are superior to the traditional algorit},

  abstract = {Consumption of natural gas, a major clean energy source, increases as energy demand increases. We studied specifically the Turkish natural gas market. Turkey's natural gas consumption increased as well in parallel with the world's over the last decade. This consumption growth in Turkey has led to the formation of a market structure for the natural gas industry. This significant increase requires additional investments since a rise in consumption capacity is expected. One of the reasons for the consumption increase is the user-based natural gas consumption influence. This effect yields imbalances in demand forecasts and if the error rates are out of bounds, penalties may occur. In this paper, three univariate statistical methods, which have not been previously investigated for mid-term year-ahead monthly natural gas forecasting, are used to forecast natural gas demand in Turkey's Sakarya province. Residential and low-consumption commercial data is used, which may contain seasonality. T},

The level of demand forecasting in retail grocery stores in the Czech Republic was the subject of the quantitative research. The main objective of the research was to find out what methods are used in demand forecasting, what factors affecting demand for food are considered and what sources of information retail stores use to base the forecasting on.

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Machine learning methods are nowadays used for many biological prediction problems involving drugs, ligands or polypeptide segments of a protein. In order to build a prediction model a so called training data set of molecules with measured target properties is needed. For many such problems the size of the training data set is limited as measurements have to be performed in a wet lab. Furthermore, the considered problems are often complex, such that it is not clear which molecular descriptors (features) may be suitable to establish a strong correlation with the target property. In many applications all available descriptors are used. This can lead to difficult machine learning problems, when thousands of descriptors are considered and only few (e.g. below hundred) molecules are available for training. RESULTS: The CoEPrA contest provides four data sets, which are typical for biological regression problems (few molecules in the training data set and thousands of descriptors). We applied the same two-step training procedure for all four regression tasks. In the first stage, we used optimized L1 regularization to select the most relevant features. Thus, the initial set of more than 6,000 features was reduced to about 50. In the second stage, we used only the selected features from the preceding stage applying a milder L2 regularization, which generally yielded further improvement of prediction performance. Our linear model employed a soft loss function which minimizes the influence of outliers. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed two-step method showed good results on all four CoEPrA regression tasks. Thus, it may be useful for many other biological prediction problems where for training only a small number of molecules are available, which are described by thousands of descriptors.},

Temporal-difference-based deep-reinforcement learning methods have
typically been driven by off-policy, bootstrap Q-Learning updates. In
this paper, we investigate the effects of using on-policy, Monte Carlo
updates. Our empirical results show that for the DDPG algorithm in a
continuous action space, mixing on-policy and off-policy update
targets exhibits superior performance and stability compared to using
exclusively one or the other. The same technique applied to DQN in a
discrete action space drastically slows down learning. Our findings
raise questions about the nature of on-policy and off-policy bootstrap
and Monte Carlo updates and their relationship to deep reinforcement
learning methods.
