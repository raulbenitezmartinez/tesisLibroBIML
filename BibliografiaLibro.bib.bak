For companies, the possibility of surviving is parallel with the accuracy of these predictions in increasing competition environment. According to this idea, demand forecast has vital importance for all companies. The purpose of the forecast is to predict situations companies may face in the future, using different data and techniques and take action in advance. Demand forecasting is to determine the demand level of a product or some products of a company for a specific time in the future. There are many methods used to forecast demand which are critical for companies. In this study, explained demand forecasting methods and made literature survey.},

  abstract = {Forecasting time series data is an important subject in economics, business, and finance. Traditionally, there are several techniques to effectively forecast the next lag of time series data such as univariate Autoregressive (AR), univariate Moving Average (MA), Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), and more notably Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with its many variations. In particular, ARIMA model has demonstrated its outperformance in precision and accuracy of predicting the next lags of time series. With the recent advancement in computational power of computers and more importantly developing more advanced machine learning algorithms and approaches such as deep learning, new algorithms are developed to forecast time series data. The research question investigated in this article is that whether and how the newly developed deep learning-based algorithms for forecasting time series data, such as "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)", are superior to the traditional algorit},

  abstract = {Consumption of natural gas, a major clean energy source, increases as energy demand increases. We studied specifically the Turkish natural gas market. Turkey's natural gas consumption increased as well in parallel with the world's over the last decade. This consumption growth in Turkey has led to the formation of a market structure for the natural gas industry. This significant increase requires additional investments since a rise in consumption capacity is expected. One of the reasons for the consumption increase is the user-based natural gas consumption influence. This effect yields imbalances in demand forecasts and if the error rates are out of bounds, penalties may occur. In this paper, three univariate statistical methods, which have not been previously investigated for mid-term year-ahead monthly natural gas forecasting, are used to forecast natural gas demand in Turkey's Sakarya province. Residential and low-consumption commercial data is used, which may contain seasonality. T},

The optimisation of order quantity, stock level, or delivery schedule depends on the aptitude of a retail operator to forecast accurately, demand at the store level. Forecasting is important in the perspective of the pharmaceutical industry, which commonly employs Price War tactics and requires efficient Supply Chain Management (SCM). Apollo Pharmacy is one of the largest retail chains in India with over 70 round-the-clock outlets. It is moving towards enabling e-prescription services to the consumers. This study was conducted to determine the accuracy of statistical forecasting techniques used in inventory planning of Apollo Pharmacy of the Apollo group in an Indian community at brick level. The retail outlet reported out-of/excess stock on certain business days. Therefore, a gap analysis was carried out and it was understood that information from custom},

  abstract = {Demand forecasting plays a key role in the management of logistics processes in retailing. The quality of the resulting forecasts has a direct impact on the efficiency of processes not only in retail stores, but also throughout the supply chain they are part of. Retail stores are in fact in daily contact with end customers in the supply chain, and therefore they are largely involved in forecasting in the application of collaborative strategies in supply chain management (e.g. Quick Response, Effective Consumer Response, Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment). The level of demand forecasting in retail grocery stores in the Czech Republic was the subject of the quantitative research. The main objective of the research was to find out what methods are used in demand forecasting, what factors affecting demand for food are considered and what sources of information retail stores use to base the forecasting on.
